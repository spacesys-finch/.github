<!-- Description of the FINCH mission patch: the Northern Hemisphere of Earth against a dark blue background with stars, and a white line sweeping around the Earth. The name FINCH is positioned at the top A blue CubeSat is above the Earth, with a visualization of the camera sensor looking at the Earth. The circular region viewed by the camera is a rainbow gradiant, representing the hyperspectral capabilities of the satellite. The circle is within the simplified shading of an eye; the camera system is known as FINCH Eye. The patch is bordered by a lighter blue border reading UTAT SPACE SYSTEMS and UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. -->

This is the GitHub organization for **FINCH**, a hyperspectral imaging CubeSat, and the second satellite made by the University of Toronto Aerospace Team Space Systems division (_UTAT Space Systems, UTAT-SS_). Here you'll find the code used by the FINCH mission, including the onboard firmware, orbital analysis tools, and operations planning.

You can find some of our biggest repos pinned to this page. We also have a list of [repos external to the organization](https://www.notion.so/utat-ss/GitHub-60cc2338aa4b48dbbea8316c1ee0e102). Our documentation and planning is hosted on [Notion](https://utat-ss.notion.site/UTAT-Space-Systems-660068a07b694305b56c483962e927c5).
