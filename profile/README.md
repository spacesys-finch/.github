This is the GitHub org for Space Systems, the student-run, student-funded, CubeSat design team at the University of Toronto. Here, you'll find the code used by our missions, including onboard firmware, analysis tools, and prototype code.

Our current mission is **FINCH**, a hyperspectral imaging CubeSat designed to map crop residue from Low Earth Orbit. We've previously built **HERON Mk. II** (also called **ARC**), a communications CubeSat, and are preparing for launch! 

You can find some of our biggest repos pinned below. Our documentation and planning are also open-source, on [Notion](https://utat-ss.notion.site/UTAT-Space-Systems-660068a07b694305b56c483962e927c5). Finally, here is a list of [repos external to the organization](https://www.notion.so/utat-ss/GitHub-60cc2338aa4b48dbbea8316c1ee0e102). 

Space Systems is a division of the University of Toronto Aerospace Team, an interdisciplinary club pushing the boundaries of rocketry, drones, satellites, and aerospace policy. Learn more about us on [utat.ca](https://www.utat.ca/space-systems), or send an email to `ss-outreach at utat dot ca`.

Let's go to space! üöÄ
